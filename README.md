# Hero-Rise

A text-based Role Playing Game (RPG) in Java.


# Main Features

## Combat

Relive the nostalgic days of classic RPGs like **FINAL FANTASY** where the main player must progress by defeating enemies. The goal is to lower the enemy's health to 0 Hit Points (HP). If your character reaches 0 HP, it is **GAME OVER!**

## Player Input

All player actions are determined by a set of provided choices. The main player must make a choice by entering the corresponding number.

## Use items in battle

If the character's HP is running low, use a health potion to turn the tides of battle.

## Drop Rate

When enemies are defeated in battle, there is the possibility of getting additional items like an extra health potion.

## Strategy

If you don't feel confident you can win the battle, it is wise to run away and try a different monster to fight.
