# Hero-Rise

An adventure Role Playing Game (RPG) in Java. The goal is to defeat as many enemies as possible, proving your status as a hero.
  

# Main Features
  
## Player Input

All player actions are determined by a set of choices shown on the screen. The player must make a choice by clicking on the corresponding choice on the GUI.

## Combat

Relive the nostalgic days of classic RPGs like **FINAL FANTASY** where the main player must progress by defeating enemies in a turn-based system. The enemies become progressingly stronger as more enemies are defeated.

### Skills and Magic

Use powerful abilities to gain an edge over the enemy! They are accessed by opening the skills or magic page.

### Damage

Damage is calculated by using a Random Number Generator (RNG).

### Use Items in Battle

Use items to turn the tides of battle. For example, use a health potion when your HP is getting low. Items can be accessed from the items page.

### Running Away

If you don't feel confident you can win the battle, it is wise to run away and try a different monster to fight. While there is only a limited number of times you can run, get more by defeating every set number of enemies.

### Help

If you need more information about certain skills and items, access the help page.

### Sub-bosses

After every set number of enemies, you will encounter a tough enemy. Give it everything you got and be rewarded for the effort!

### After Combat

When enemies are defeated in battle, there is the possibility of getting additional items.
